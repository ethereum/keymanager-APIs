  title: "Eth2 key manager API"
  description: |
    API specification for a key manager client, which enables users to manage keystores.

    The key manager API is served by the binary holding the validator keys. This binary may be a remote signer or a validator client.

    All routes SHOULD be exposed through a secure channel, such as with HTTPs, an SSH tunnel, a VPN, etc.

    All requests by default send and receive JSON, and as such should have either or both of the "Content-Type: application/json"
    and "Accept: application/json" headers.

    All sensitive routes are to be authenticated with a token. This token should be provided by the user via a secure channel:
      - Log the token to stdout when running the binary with the key manager API enabled
      - Read the token from a file available to the binary
