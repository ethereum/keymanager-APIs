  title: "Eth2 key manager API"
  description: |
    API specification for a key manager client, which enables users to manage keystores.

    The key manager API is served by the binary holding the validator keys. This binary may be a remote signer or a validator client.

    All routes SHOULD be exposed through a secure channel, such as with HTTPs, an SSH tunnel, a VPN, etc.

    All requests by default send and receive JSON, and as such should have either or both of the "Content-Type: application/json"
    and "Accept: application/json" headers.

    All sensitive routes are to be authenticated with a token. This token should be provided by the user via a secure channel:
      - Log the token to stdout when running the binary with the key manager API enabled
      - Read the token from a file available to the binary

    delete:
      operationId: DeleteKeys
      summary: Delete Keys.
      description: |
        DELETE must delete all keys from `request.pubkeys` that are known to the keymanager and exist in its
        persistent storage. Additionally, DELETE must fetch the slashing protection data for the requested keys from
        persistent storage, which must be retained (and not deleted) after the response has been sent. Therefore in the
        case of two identical delete requests being made, both will have access to slashing protection data.

        In a single atomic sequential operation the keymanager must:
        1. Guarantee that key(s) can not produce any more signature; only then
        2. Delete key(s) and serialize its associated slashing protection data

        DELETE should never return a 404 response, even if all pubkeys from request.pubkeys have no extant keystores
        nor slashing protection data.
