  title: "Eth2 key manager API"
  description: |
    API specification for a key manager client, which enables users to manage keystores.

    The key manager API is served by the binary holding the validator keys. This binary may be a remote signer or a validator client.

    All routes SHOULD be exposed through a secure channel, such as with HTTPs, an SSH tunnel, a VPN, etc.

    All requests by default send and receive JSON, and as such should have either or both of the "Content-Type: application/json"
    and "Accept: application/json" headers.

    All sensitive routes MUST be authenticated with a token.

    The keymanager binary SHOULD accept a configuration parameter: `token-file`, which designates a file containing the hex-encoded token
    of at least 256 bits. If such a parameter is not given, the client SHOULD generate such a token and write it to a file, to be reused
    across multiple restarts of the binary. If such a parameter is given, but the file or token cannot be read, the client SHOULD treat this
    as an error: either abort the startup, or show the error and continue without exposing the keymanager routes.
